    <h1>Hot Spinach Artichoke Dip</h1>
    <img src="../images/spinash.png" />
    <p>
      This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If
      you don't like artichokes, don't worry â€” you'll never know they're in
      there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of
      the dish?
