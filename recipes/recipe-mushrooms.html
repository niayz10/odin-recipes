    <h1>Perfect Crab-Stuffed Mushrooms</h1>
    <img src="../images/mushrooms.png" />
    <p>
      These little goodies are the perfect addition to your next holiday
      gathering or even the perfect appetizer to serve before a cozy dinner at
      home. Everyone will be dazzled by every delicious bite (they won't be able
      to keep their hands off of them!) You can smile while you think of how
      easy they were to toss together! And the best part - I usually end up with
      leftover stuffing, which freezes beautifully until the next carry-in!
